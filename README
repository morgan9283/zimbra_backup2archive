Restore part of an archive from a Zimbra backup.

Based on Adam Cody's instructions: https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Troubleshooting_Course_Content_Rough_Drafts-Recover_Missing_Data_-_User#Redirected_Restore_With_No_Deletes_To_Then_Import_Data_From_A_Specific_Time_Range_Into_A_Subdirectory_Of_Users_Archive_Account

Suggested usage, note that -p refers to the file being written to by
tee -a.  This allows you to re-start where you left off should the
script end in an error.

This can't run while the backups are running so you
should specify an end time (-p) that is a few minutes before you
backups start.  Ours start at 21:00.
